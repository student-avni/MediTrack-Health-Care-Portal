⚕️ MediTrack: DBMS-Based Healthcare Portal
Project Overview
MediTrack is a robust, DBMS-based healthcare portal designed to manage essential patient, appointment, and medical record data efficiently.

This application serves as a central hub for health facility management, enabling:

Patient Registration: Secure creation and management of patient profiles.

Appointment Booking: Scheduling and tracking of patient appointments with doctors.

Medical Records Management: Storage and retrieval of diagnostic data and health history.

->Technology Stack
This project is built using a combination of foundational web technologies and a powerful database management system:

Backend: Node.js

Database: MySQL (DBMS)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

->Getting Started
To set up and run MediTrack locally, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

MySQL Server (or a similar relational database environment)

2. Database Setup
Create a new database in your MySQL environment named meditrack_db.

Import the initial schema and dummy data (assuming you have a .sql file).

3. Application Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/student-avni/MediTrack-Health-Care-Portal.git](https://github.com/student-avni/MediTrack-Health-Care-Portal.git)
cd MediTrack-Health-Care-Portal

Install dependencies:

npm install

Configure Database Connection:

Create a configuration file (e.g., .env or config.js) to store your MySQL connection details (username, password, database name).

Run the application:

npm start

The portal should now be running, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000.
